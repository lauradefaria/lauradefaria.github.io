                            <h4>Logic Circuits I - Boolean Algebra - assistant instructor</h4>A freshman class at UFPB that has the highest failing rates. Throughout the course, I gave lectures, provided support with exercises and projects, and conducted practical lessons on logic circuits. Additionally, I developed a laboratory guide to help students apply the course concepts through hands-on activities. Our work was recognized with a Teaching Initiation Award by the University.

                            As Secretary of the Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) at IEEE UFPB Student Branch, I was responsible for organizing and promoting training sessions and notebooks for teaching content such as Python, Data Structures, Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and API handling. I also scheduled tutoring sessions to support participants' technical development, assisted in organizing meetings and completing minutes, and managed documentation for projects carried out by the chapter.
